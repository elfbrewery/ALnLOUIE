<p>     Surely you would be crazy to voluntarily go to this most notorious prison, but in this era of reality television -- why not! The group of islands made famous in the book and movie "Papillon," starring Steve Mc Queen, ceased to be a French penal colony in 1947. These are located 10 miles off the coast of French Guyana on the Northeast shoulder of South America. Until recently the prison languished and then, like Alcatraz and Robbens Island, it was declared a national park.  It is serviced by a once a day passenger ferry. </p>

Fortunately the ticket lady accommodated two other late arrivals and us. Surviving the crossing was another thing all together. The normally rough seas were one of the reasons for selecting these particular islands for a prison.</p>
<p><img src="images/DevilIs2.jpg" align="left" width="170" height="150" alt="Just like home..." style="padding-right: 20px"/> Our first impression was not what we expected. The islands were surrounded by blue seas and covered with coconut palm trees, the very picture of a tropical paradise. Monkeys cavorted in the trees while deer and agouti (palm rats) scampered through the brush as we walked the entire island. </p>
<p>Our tour included visiting the cells, the museum,  the barracks, church and hospital. The rusted bars and dank, dreary cells quickly dispelled any allusion of paradise. Nowadays, better accomodation can be attained at  the large administration building, which has been converted into a hotel/restaurant. So, if you can't get your fill in six hours, you can spend the night, as well as take a dip in the swimming area created by the prisoners, provided you're convinced that the sharks that feasted on the bodies of dead convicts have given up waiting. <img src="images/DevilIs3.jpg" align="right" width="113" height="150" alt="Get me outta here!" style="padding-left: 20px"/></p>
<p>Not on the top of most holiday lists, but how many people can say, "I escaped from Devil's Island!"</p>

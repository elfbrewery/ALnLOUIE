	<h1>&#39;Round the World (2000-2001)</h1>
	</div>
<p>Having made the round trip to Spain several times and finding it expensive, 
especially from the west coast of North America, we decided to go just one way: 
'round the world. So on the second of October, 2000 we slung our packs on our 
backs and walked from our home on Gabriola Island to Silva Bay and boarded a 
float plane. Thus began our journey of seven months, in which time we  visited 
18 countries, 14 of which were new to us. The following is a compilation of the 
e-mails we sent during our travels.</p>

Louie wanted to start this with a Hawaiian expression, this is the 
only one I can spell.  If you don't 'get it' ask an older person. 
Needless to say we arrived safely and are relaxing on the North Shore 
of Oahu (surrounded by surfers). Maui might have been better, but we 
like it here. We've cycled, swum with big sea turtles and climbed 
Diamond Head. Finally caught up with our passports and are headed for 
Japan.<br/>
Sayonara!</p>

The Chopsticks Trail started in Japan, which was clean, efficent and 
very expensive.  We used Kyoto as a base and visited Nara (the ancient 
capitol), Hiroshima (skipped the bomb dome), Miyajima Island, Himeji, 
and saw: bunches of buddhas, tons of temples, a series of shrines, 
plenty pagodas and a couple castles.</p>
<p>Korea wasn't quite as clean or expensive, but was efficent. From 
Seoul we visited Namhansansong, an enormous fortress in the Mountains. 
The temple architecture was similar to Japan, but much more colorful. 
From Seoul we flew to Hong Kong and on to Guilin. Spending five hours 
in the Hong Kong airport was a real treat -- like watching grass grow.</p>

alt="The eerie hills between Yangshuo and Guilin along the Li River" align="left"/>
China was less clean, less efficent and cheaper. Much of our time was
spent on the water. An 8-hour cruise on the Li River, land of 
mysterious hills resembling dragons teeth, was followed by a three day 
cruise of the Three Gorges, the site of the world's largest dam, which 
will back up the Yantze River for 600km all the way to Chung King (see 
Nat'l Geo article June 2000? for details).</p>
<p><img src="images/datong.jpg" height="97" width="130" style="padding-left: 10px"
alt="The Hanging Monastery hidden in the mountains away from Datong" align="right"/>
We have used our chopsticks on a vast variety of foods, some of which
we knew what they were. From Chung King we headed North visiting the Terracotta 
Army, the Hanging Monastery and A place with 50,000 statues of Buddha. And finally, 
on to Beijing! Where we saw the Great Wall, the Ming Temples and a rip off 
Chineese medicine clinic... and had the obligatory Peking Duck dinner.</p>

<p>When we had a free day in northern China, Al wanted to go to Mongolia 
to look for the Yeti, but Louie vetoed the 10 hour bus ride and 
said Nepal is a better place. </p>
<p>Kathmandu is so overrun with tourists, 
souvenir vendors, tri-shaws, taxi's and trucks, our reclusive quarry 
certainly wasn't here. Flying over Everest we scanned the slopes, but 
no sight of oversized feet... On our way to Chitwan National Park we 
saw Yeti hotels, Yeti restaurants and Yeti souvenir shops, even trucks 
with Yeti tires but not their namesake. In the park we observed rhino, 
marsh mugger crocodiles and maybe a gharial. Attempts to go into the 
jungle to look were delayed and finally forbidden due to a wild 
elephant. We felt this was only an excuse until the pachyderm killed a 
local. This left us no choice but to go to Tibet.</p>
<p><img src="images/tibet3.jpg" height="75" width="65"  style="padding-right: 10px"
alt="frequent sight in a temple" align="left"/>
For five days we struggled over the Himalayas at elevations above 
5,000 meters (17,500 feet) suffering headaches, nausea and 
lightheadedness, searched the open wind-burned faces of the Tibetans, 
scoured monasteries that smelled of burning yak butter and paid tribute 
to the manifestations of every Buddha and numbered lama one could think 
of. Paintings of huge feet suggested his existence, but no real proof.</p>

In Lhasa we finally slept well, being down to 3650 meters (12,000 ft.). 
However, the town is too civilized since the Chinese arrived. A bus 
ride on Yeti Encounter bus lines failed to do just that. Our last 
chance is in India -- we'll keep a sharp eye as we fly to Delhi.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p><img src="images/TajMahal.jpg" height="50" width="75"  style="padding-right: 10px"

We made about the fastest trip to the Taj Mahal possible. We flew into
Delhi, stayed two nights and flew out. The day we spent in India 
consisted of boarding the Taj Express train early in the morning, 
hiring a taxi and guide for the day in Agra and spending more time at 
shops the guide wanted us to visit rather than the Taj and Agra Fort.  
We enjoyed the Taj Mahal as best we could to get our money's worth. The
inside of the mausoleum doesn't take long to see. In some respects we 
enjoyed the Red Fort better; it had nice views of the Taj across the 
water.</p>
<p>We didn't escape Delhi-belly even though we ate at a clean vegetarian 
restaurant for lunch. It didn't help us feel rewarded by our trip to 
India.</p>
<p>The day we left Delhi we travelled in 4 countries. Our flight to 
Bahrain had us change planes in Muscat, Oman and then spend some time 
on the ground in Abu Dhabi. Our timing for Bahrain was miserable 
because we arrived on a Thursday and everything was shut for Friday and
Saturday, including the national museum. Besides, it rained 
(bah! rain!) and we both were still ill. Sunday found us taking the bus 
all over the area on the way to the airport, but that's all we got to 
see.</p>
<p>Due to Ramadan we found the evenings in Syria and Jordan a little 
boring. Not only did we have difficulty having any kind of breakfast, 
but most restaurants were closed and the few we found open for dinner 
were empty. That with Jordan having a ban on alcohol sales for the 
entire month, we wound up with no coffee in the morning and no beer at 
night...</p>
<p><img src="images/petra.jpg" height="98" width="75"  style="padding-left: 10px"
alt="This is not from a make-believe set for Indiana Jones" align="right"/>
However, the sights were really worth seeing. We visited Aleppo, Hama,
Crac de Chevaliers, Palmyra, Damascus, Amman, Jerash, Madaba and Petra 
(2 day pass). PETRA is obviously our favorite spot. After seeing that, 
I think we couldn't imagine anything more fascinating!! Not only is the geology at 
least as interesting as Zion NP, but the history and architecture are 
captivating. The colors in the rocks really had us in awe.</p>
<p><img src="images/cyprus.jpg" height="98" width="65"  style="padding-right: 10px"
alt="Kourion temple" align="left"/>
After that we flew to Cyprus. It made a nice 
break. Easy to get around, more expensive, though. Would make a good 
place to travel around by bike! We especially enjoyed wandering around
the old ruins, tombs, castles and museums. We visited Northern Cyprus
for lunch and, although we were warned by the Cypriots that the Turks would
kill us, we survived the pleasant experience without any cause for 
caution.</p>
<p>We could have spent more time on Cyprus, but the weather in the 
mountains was cold and wet and we were still recovering our health. So, 
the only solution was to head for Spain. The Costa del Sol would cure us.
We spent our normal winter in Spain biking and walking for exercise and 
attending fiestas and carnival for entertainment. Stops in Philly and Kansas 
gave us time to visit relatives and a brief bar tour in Denver. And finally on 
the fourth of April we climbed off the float plane and walked home. It sure felt 
good to be there.</p>

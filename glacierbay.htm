				a DOUBLE helping of wilderness

		</div>
		<p>
		It probably started when we bought the "Pea Pod," officially known as an 
		Old Towne Otter kayak. It's only 9 1/2 feet long and is green prompting a 
		passer by to tell Louie she looked like she was in a pea pod. It took over 
		two years to finally make the decision to buy it. We both wanted a small 
		simple water craft we could transport with us on our camping trips to take 
		advantage of all the lakes and streams we camped by. The obstacle was that 
		Al wanted a canoe and Louie a kayak, and we both didn't want the other. 
		Louie did not like the paddle for a canoe and not being in control if she 
		sat in front; all of Al's experiences in a kayak involved getting wet. 
		Finally, in 1997, we agreed to get something. A $1200 plastic two person 
		kayak with holes in it that required wet suits was not the answer; the $200 
		used Coleman canoe seemed very heavy. At last we found the "Pea Pod" -- 
		small, one sits IN it not ON it, and only $400 including paddle and PFD. So 
		we became kayakers. We could use it only one person at a time; however, for 
		rivers this was ideal. One of us would put in, then paddle to a 
		predetermined spot downstream, the other would shuttle with the van and then 
		swap places or pickup kayak and paddler. We really loved it! Our summer 
		and autumn saw us padding all over the US.
		</p>
		<p>
		In late '97 we decided to plan a return trip to Alaska to see the islands 
		of the Inside Passage which we had missed on our 1991 travels. Kayaking was 
		definitely a possibility and Louie started emailing, writing, and 
		800-calling for info. Our first idea was to buy a folding two person kayak 
		and take it with us. At $2000-$3000 this was a bit expensive, but then we 
		considered the nightmare of transporting it plus the additional stowage 
		costs on the ferries to get us to our destination -- this idea became 
		unwieldy. Stuck for weeks with little information coming in as to how we 
		could enjoy the wilds of Alaska on our terms, we were elated to receive a 
		brochure in the mail from Glacier Bay Sea Kayaks. Not only do they work 
		with the National Park Service to allow people to explore the park and rent 
		kayaks to do that, they arranged transport to/from/within the park and we 
		could paddle to our hearts' content on our own for as many days as we 
		wished. They even gave us suggestions on how WE could accomplish a trip in 
		the wilderness as well as an extensive checklist. Our dream was taking 
		shape. We would rent a double kayak, arrange a drop-off in Muir Inlet and 
		paddle up and back the East Arm returning to park headquarters on our own. 
		Eight days of backcountry camping and kayaking -- WOW!
		</p>
		<p>
		By return mail we received a list of the required gear. This was enough to 
		give the faint-hearted second thoughts. We needed SO MUCH STUFF and most of 
		it had to be wool. We were going in summer (early June), but the list 
		looked like preparations for a polar expedition! After many visits to pawn 
		shops, thrift stores, liquidation centers and bank tellers we were ready. 
		We even bought a cart to haul all our gear, which also included 25 pounds of 
		dehydrated food and 100 granola bars. How it would all fit in one kayak 
		with two of us was a mystery.
		</p>
		<p>
		Leaving our van in Port Hardy, B.C. we took ferries for the next five days 
		visiting Prince Rupert, B.C., the cities and islands along the Alaska Marine 
		Highway, then on to Juneau, Alaska. From there we took a water bus to 
		Bartlett Cove in Glacier Bay National Park. We were immediately immersed in 
		wildlife seeing a black bear and two porcupines right outside the Ranger 
		Station. Next we received our instructions and pertinent equipment at the 
		NPS contact station: 2 bear canisters, backcountry permits, nautical chart 
		and viewing a 20 minute video informing us where to keep our food, etc., in 
		order to avoid bear encounters. After several frustrating attempts to load 
		our food into the bear canisters, we exchanged one for a larger oil drum 
		style, which gave us only just enough food storage capacity and left us even 
		more in doubt as to how all this stuff was going to fit into the kayak.
		</p>
		<p>
		At 5 p.m. Kara from Glacier Bay Sea Kayaks appeared at the kayak shack to 
		issue us paddles, spray skirts, rain gear, kayak and give a brief demo. She 
		answered a few questions and asked for money. Then she pointed us in the 
		direction of the "Spirit of Adventure" only a few yards away and told us to 
		paddle over while she walked out onto the dock to meet us. This was our 
		introduction to the kayak and how difficult it was going to be to carry it 
		and load it on and off the NPS boat that would drop us off in the morning. 
		After Kara helped us get kayak 11 on the deck of The Spirit along with 
		several other kayaks also going out in the morning, she simply told us to 
		report at 7:15 a.m. with all our gear.
		</p>
		<p>
		[DAY 1] We were up before 06:00 breaking camp to get organized before 
		enjoying breakfast. Employing a borrowed NPS wheel barrow we moved all our 
		gear, each parcel double bagged in plastic, to the dock. Five other 
		kayakers were set to join us on The Spirit, two photographers each paddling 
		a double kayak and three young people from Texas who would each paddle his 
		own single. As all the gear was loaded it became evident to us that if WE 
		had trouble loading OUR stuff, the others would never make it. The Texans 
		had nine bear cans and innumerable dry sacks.
		</p>
		<p>
		We kayakers were in the minority on The Spirit because the boat's more 
		lucrative business was wildlife tours and today there were about 50 
		"white-legged tourists" sharing the trip. Al coined this term for people 
		who tour from plane to bus to boat to bus and so forth never escaping the 
		protection of the tour operators. As we headed north into Glacier Bay the 
		whole group shared viewing puffins, a sea lion colony and a sea otter.
		Each of the kayaking groups had separate itineraries. The two 
		photographers wished to be dropped in the West Arm. Our three companions, 
		the Texans, planned five days kayaking in Muir Inlet and then being 
		transported to the West Arm for another five days. We wished to stay in 
		Muir Inlet and then return to Bartlett Cove under our own power via the 
		Beardslee Islands. A little after 10:00 a.m. Al, Louie and the three Texans 
		were dropped off at Mt. Wright, a steep rocky beach at the southend of Muir 
		Inlet. All of the above pitched in to chaingang the kayaks and the mass of 
		supplies onto the beach. If someone had been here waiting to be picked-up, 
		we would then have had to help load them onto the ship, but today we were 
		lucky; we had enough work ahead of us.
		</p>
		<p>
		No sooner had the last piece of gear hit the beach than The Spirit was 
		pulling away. The spectators returned to looking for other forms of 
		entertainment as we turned to stare at our pile and the kayak. Now what? 
		Never having done this before, the challenge of getting loaded sensibly and 
		safely, a serious matter, was something we were going to learn by doing. We 
		managed as well as others must, it actually all fit! The inside of the 
		kayak was lined with every one of our belongings leaving just enough space 
		for us to slip in and out. But before we jumped in, we would have to get 
		the craft into the bay. The tide, a constant concern, was going out. This 
		meant that the distance from the kayak to the water kept expanding. Two 
		people cannot lift a loaded 17 ft. double kayak. When we finished packing, 
		the Texans helped us lug the kayak down the beach. Then the realization hit 
		us -- bang! -- it was time to launch. Louie climbed in, then fastened her 
		spray skirt in place. We also attached lines to the paddles to minimize the 
		possibility of loss. Al slid into the back, Louie having declined the offer 
		to operate the rudder. Sea kayaks, spray skirts, rudders were all new to 
		us; the Pea Pod is so much simpler. However, the Pea Pod would not do for 
		this adventure. Al struggled with his spray skirt and then -- we pushed 
		off. Now Al released the rudder line, but the rudder refused to drop into 
		place. The rudder would be a problem child the entire trip. It is almost 
		impossible to steer an ocean double kayak without a rudder. Due to the 
		limitation of squirming around with the spray skirt firmly attached, Al 
		reached back with his paddle and knocked the rudder into place, a trick he 
		would learn to master. It is important to raise the rudder when approaching 
		shore, especially when backing in, meaning that the rudder is already up 
		when one launches. Careful study showed that a round d-ring clip that held 
		the rudder pin in place had to be facing forward and down in order for the 
		rudder cable to ramp over it and not get caught, but there was no way to 
		insure it would stay in this position. It had to be checked before each 
		launch five or six times a day. Obviously, one of these times we'd forget 
		and it would be in the wrong position.
		</p>
		<p>
		We bid pleasant journey to our three acquaintances and started paddling 
		north toward McBride Glacier, the only tidewater glacier in the East Arm. 
		We rounded a point and heard pebbles rolling down the slope of a steep 
		cliff. High above us a group of mountain goats were making their way across 
		the rock face. We watched through our binoculars for several minutes. What 
		a marvelous feeling to see wildlife from the kayak only minutes from setting 
		out.
		</p>
		<p>
		Southeast Alaska is known as wet, cold, often a gloomy place. All during 
		our planning the possibility of a soggy eight days lurked in the back of our 
		minds, especially when buying long underwear and waterproofing our bags. 
		But not today! The sky was clear, the sun shown down on glistening blue 
		water and the exquisite snow-capped mountains of the Fairweather Range, an 
		appropriate name for once.
		</p>
		<p>
		We figured the glacier was twenty miles away, a two day paddle. Our 
		estimate was two days up, two days back to Mt. Wright and three easy days 
		south to Bartlett Cove with one day in reserve for bad weather. As we 
		reached the mouth of Adams Inlet we passed three kayakers going the other 
		way, one had a huge crab trap mounted on the rear of his kayak (and we 
		thought we had a lot of stuff!). He said he had caught only small crabs. 
		Shortly thereafter we were passed by a humpback whale. Hearing the big 
		whoosh as he surfaced and then seeing his fluke (tail) raised in the air as 
		he sounded (dove) was a sight we would see often, but never tire of. Soon 
		another whale passed and we watched as they both turned right to enter the 
		inlet joined by several harbor dolphins; the feeding must be good at the 
		mouth of the inlet.
		</p>
		<p>
		We had been paddling for an hour. Checking the chart 
		it seemed a short distance to George Point -- a good place to break for 
		lunch. We paddled and paddled. The point drew no closer. Al's shoulders 
		cramped, our arms grew weary, and still we seemed no closer. Whales, 
		dolphins, and harbor seals frolicked in the sunshine as we labored. Finally 
		nearing the limit of our sanity and strength we reached a beach just short 
		of the point. It had taken two and a half hours. Upon checking the chart 
		we calculated we'd covered five miles. This was absurd. Thoughts of how to 
		abort our mission or get picked up at Mt. Wright crept into our minds. 
		</p>
		<p>
		After lunch and some fruit plus an hour's rest we set off again. Hooray! 
		The rudder fell into place. Rounding the point we decided to abandon our 
		plan of sticking close to shore in order to save some time. Setting our 
		sights on the next point we paddled straight for it. The clear air and 
		vivid visibility made everything seem close. Two hours later we drug 
		ourselves upon a rocky beach. We calculated we had covered three more 
		miles, then just shook our heads. This beach would do for a break, but not 
		for tent camping. However, always mindful of the bears, we heeded Park Service 
		advice to prepare dinner, eat and clean up somewhere away from camp. Now 
		was the time. Dinner was Al's special instant mashed potatoes with powdered 
		cheese and some hunks of pepperoni, the only meat we would have. During 
		both of our breaks the three Texans passed us while we sat on the beach. 
		They weren't doing much better than we were.
		</p>
		<p>
		Back in the kayak we rounded the point discovering that the three other 
		kayakers were apparently searching for a water source. Yes, one must find 
		his own water out here, not having the capacity to carry all that is 
		required. Even "Baby Huey," our large unwieldy four gallon bladder was not 
		enough for eight days. The team of three left the shore and managed to stay 
		in the lead, maybe they were afraid we would find a choice campsite before 
		they would. Following them around another abrupt outcrop we encountered 
		sheer cliffs -- no campsite there. When a low grassy crowned beach 
		appeared, we headed in; our paddling day was finished.
		</p>
		<p>
		On the beach we found animal tracks and moose droppings, but no bear. We 
		set up camp on the grassy spot, which required carrying all of our gear 
		thirty or forty yards to insure we were above the high tide line. One does 
		not want to wake up afloat or find his kayak and equipment floating away, or 
		not find it at all! The unloading took five round trips apiece plus one for 
		the kayak. We began to worry more about the tide while on the shore than in 
		the kayak. As Al trudged down the beach to cache the bear canisters high 
		above the shore in some rocks, Louie grabbed the chart and stared. Why was 
		it so difficult to gauge our progress? Would we ever see the glacier? In 
		this respect our spirits were pretty low; however, conditions had been 
		perfect and we had seen many more marine mammals than expected, plus loads 
		of bald eagles!
		</p>
		<p>
		Yet, our main objective was the glacier. If Louie's calculations were 
		correct, it was still 12 to 15 miles to go. Could we manage to paddle that 
		hard everyday? Louie turned to Al and said "That island," pointing to a 
		lump of land in mid-channel, "isn't on the chart." Al studied the island 
		and then the chart. "It has to be. Nothing that big could not be." Louie 
		concurred and continued to stare at the chart. "There's an island way up 
		here on the chart." Al looked. "It's got to be that island. We're not 
		down there, we're up here!" "But we both agreed we're here," Louie 
		returned to pointing at the debated original guess. "But that island has to 
		be this one," Al countered. "Look, if this point is really that one, and 
		that one is really this one -- we're here -- which means we covered 18 miles 
		and my shoulders agree." Neither one of us wanted to raise false 
		expectations. Well before the sun would set the bugs drove us inside the 
		tent to where we put our mixed emotions out of mind while sleeping like 
		logs.
		</p>
		<p>
		[DAY 2] The morning dawned overcast, hiding just the very tops of the 
		mountains we had admired the day before. Doubts as to our correct location 
		still dogged us as we continued north. Rounding a point we spotted the 
		tents and kayaks of our three traveling companions. The cove seemed to 
		lead to a freshwater outlet, thus we followed it to the mouth of a small 
		stream where we employed our water filter for the first time. Meanwhile, Al 
		prepared the morning repast of coffee and muffins (the last of our fresh 
		food). The sandy beach was covered with moose and bear tracks, so we kept a 
		wary eye as we conducted our chores.
		</p>
		<p>
		Paddling back past the others' campsite we could see no sign of activity. 
		Much like our experiences on our 89-91 bike trip* the younger set like to 
		sleep in forgetting that the wind does also. Back in the bay we estimated 
		that McBride glacier was around a large headland in the distance probably 
		another half day's paddling. If it wasn't, we would really be disappointed; 
		maybe have to turn back. After an hour we took a short break, attempting to 
		fortify each other's spirits.
		<br />
		[(*)see "The Farther You Travel the Closer You Get to Yourself" -- The Bike Trip]
		</p>
		<p>
		Back in the kayak we were just settling into our rhythm and passing a small 
		promitory when a gigantic wall of deep blue ice appeared on our right! It 
		was the glacier! It was McBride! It was only eight o'clock on the second 
		day and we were there! All of our concerns and fears washed away in a 
		heartbeat. Our morale soared to new heights. Life is good.
		</p>
		<p>
		The tide had just turned to go out, though. This meant approaching the 
		glacier upstream by kayak was a very bad idea. Beaching our craft we walked 
		to within a respectable distance to listen and watch chunks of ice split off 
		from the face and form icebergs which joined in a column that was now 
		marching past us beginning their short journey down the bay before melting 
		within five miles of their birth. Our choice of whether to proceed farther north
		up the bay was made for us. The bergs had formed a moving wall as they 
		crossed the bay before us from west to east turning south well out in the 
		channel. It would be foolhardy to try and paddle between them. The 
		cavalcade would last another six hours. We split our one hour visit 
		between viewing the glacier and moving the kayak. Just because a two to 
		three foot change in tide would occur during that hour didn't mean that we 
		would be moving the kayak just two or three feet. It was a constant job to 
		monitor the craft that's too heavy to lift, so one of us (usually Al) would 
		anchor it, trudge over to the glacier in his rubber boots (the appropriate 
		paddling footwear), take a minute to watch the seals, birds, icebergs and 
		glacier, turnaround and trudge back to move the kayak, which would almost be 
		totally high and dry by then. We were told repeatedly NOT to drag the kayak. 
		The rocks are covered with barnacles and the shell of the kayak would not 
		last long, especially fully loaded, if it were to be scoured by dragging.
		</p>
		<p>
		As we traveled south very thrilled by the glacier and much relieved about 
		our schedule we were treated to seals, moms and pups, floating along on the 
		bergs. Most of them evacuated as we overtook them, but one brave soul 
		remained in place looking like a plump bathing beauty on her private little 
		beach.
		</p>
		<p>
		Camp that night was on a beach against a sheer rock wall. The sun had come 
		out and we enjoyed a tranquil night having covered another 15 miles. This 
		night, like the first one, we put Baby Huey, our water container, on top of 
		the overturned kayak, not wanting to lay it on any sharp objects.
		</p>
		<p>
		Buzzzz, buzzzz, buzzzzzz... What's that? A hummingbird! Golly, up here in 
		the wilderness near a glacier! These hearty souls gave us a boost every 
		afternoon thereafter.
		</p>
		<p>
		[DAY 3] When Louie arose in the morning, Baby Huey was gone. She started 
		to search for it with some strange ideas as to what had happened to it when 
		all of a sudden she heard clattering and splashing noises. A cow moose with 
		calf had been coming up the closed off end of the beach. When it saw Louie 
		it bolted into the bay in an attempt to swim around us. Louie turned to try 
		to get back away from the startled pair. About then Al emerged from the 
		tent to see the moose far out in the bay. His elation turned to remorse 
		when he learned how they got there. Gosh, we knew moose liked water, but to 
		swim in saltwater that plummeted to double-digit fathoms as soon as it left 
		the beach was remarkable.
		</p>
		<p>
		There was nothing we could do and we needed to continue our hunt for Baby 
		Huey and retrieve our food before the tide came in. Louie found the water 
		bladder in some rocks a few yards down the beach. Dew must have aided its 
		slide off the kayak and the tumble down the beach into the sea was a 
		feasible possibility. Fortunately it was only covered in seaweed and not 
		punctured. Our drama with the moose was not over, though. The mother 
		wanted to keep swimming, but the calf couldn't keep up. While Al was 
		fetching the bear canisters from the rocky shelf at the end of the beach the 
		calf made up its own mind to head straight for shore, which was straight at 
		Al. The cow was frantic and caught up quickly. Al retreated up the beach 
		to sit with Louie calmly by the kayak. The mother moose was not convinced; 
		she and the calf stood in the water ready to plunge back in. The calf was 
		shivering and looked very pathetic. Our hearts hurt, but we were unable to 
		help. The nervous mother kept licking the calf and growling at us (yes, 
		moose growl). This went on for some time; the moose were not going to make 
		the first move. Because of the rock wall behind us, we couldn't move much 
		either. "Maybe if we act normal, they'll relax," Al suggested. So, we 
		started to break camp. It seemed to be working, but as Al was walking in a 
		parallel path towards the rear of the moose, she decided she'd had enough 
		and, giving a loud grunt, charged! Al, who had not taken his eyes off her, 
		followed the park ranger's instructions exactly -- he ran as fast as he 
		could to scramble up the rocks. The moose stopped; with a grunt it returned 
		to the calf. Al stayed on the rock. Louie was in the tent, so only heard 
		the commotion. She emerged to see the moose glaring at her as well. 
		Finally, step by step the displeased pair moved up the beach, then later 
		trotted off with cautious glances back at us. We were relieved to see the 
		calf had stopped shivering, but had we given the calf a false sense that it 
		had done the right thing by coming to shore? What if we had been wolves? 
		Ninety percent of moose calves die.
		</p>
		<p>
		Paddling south we found a small inlet at the mouth of a rocky swift stream 
		just big enough into which we nudged the kayak. A good source for fresh 
		water and solitude for breakfast.
		</p>
		<p>
		At Adams Inlet the marine show resumed: whales, dolphins, seals, birds. 
		We beached on the south shore to enjoy the show. Due to sheer cliffs on 
		this part of the coast we had difficulty finding a campsite, finally 
		settling on a flat rocky place, using our extra clothing to pad the bottom 
		of the tent. It had been another sunny day, so we bathed in a nearby stream 
		letting the sun rapidly dry our tanning bodies. We hadn't seen anyone else 
		the entire day.
		</p>
		<p>
		[DAY 4] Knowing that the beach at the dropoff/pickup point was only a short 
		paddle down the coast we made sure we were well past it by 9:30 am so that 
		The Spirit would not think we wanted a ride. In reality we were miles past 
		that point just north of Puffin Island when we at last found a suitable 
		beach on which to take a break. We knew The Spirit would be around this 
		area between 9:00 and 10:00, that's why we were waiting for it to leave. We 
		wanted the cove to ourselves. Sure enough The Spirit appeared, circled 
		Puffin Island and was headed up the bay. "Don't wave," admonished Al, "We 
		don't want the crew to think we're in trouble." No sooner had he said this 
		that the ship made a hard right coming directly at us. "Oh, MANNNN! What 
		are they doing?" As the catamaran bore down on us we looked down the beach 
		to see two young bull moose picking their way right for us. "Not again!" 
		We weren't scared, just concerned that now we were in the moose's way. It 
		was our obligation to get out of their path. We headed for the kayak and Louie 
		jumped in ready to hit the water without worrying about spray skirts and such 
		stuff. But The Spirit got its laugh on us because we couldn't have timed a 
		worse exit, the bow wave hit us before Al could climb in and we were forced 
		sideways, bounced in towards the beach and almost capsized. Al was still in 
		the water trying to point the kayak into the waves while his boots filled 
		with water. He scampered aboard and we quickly paddled away from the moose 
		and The Spirit. The entertainment value for the passengers must have been 
		worth the trouble the ship put us through....
		</p>
		<p>
		Now that The Spirit was under way north we continued our tour of Sandy 
		Cove. The passage marked on the chart no longer existed forcing us to 
		retrace our progress and proceed around the cove. We were learning about 
		glacial rebound, that is, land springing up after undoing the compaction 
		from the glacial load.
		</p>
		<p>
		Before the end of the day we needed to reach Wolf Creek, the end of the 
		"bear exclusion zone" -- the bears weren't excluded, just humans were not 
		allowed to camp there in order to allow the bears undisturbed breeding 
		habitat.
		</p>
		<p>
		On our way to Wolf Creek we entered a small cove just as three whales did; 
		they surfaced right in front of us. Attempting to follow the "no approach" 
		rule, we stopped paddling to allow the whales clear passage (as if our puny 
		little kayak would bother them). A power boat approached from the opposite 
		direction and pulled up right on top of the whales. Louie had a fit! She 
		was going to report these rule breakers!! That is, until she read the NPS 
		logo on the boat hull.... We later learned that it was a research team; 
		they don't have to obey their own rules. They waved at us to indicate their 
		appreciation of our conduct. One of the whales made a strange bugling 
		foghorn sound when it blew. We guessed it must have had a deformed 
		blowhole, certainly a unique sound. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The weather had grown cloudy and blustery with a heavy chop in the bay. Our
		camp was near a stream providing plenty of fresh water and the breeze kept the
		bugs away. Louie said she saw two guys in red suits out in the middle of the
		rough seas -- turned out to 
		be a buoy....
		</p>
		<p>
		[DAY 5] A real Glacier Bay day, heavy overcast all day, but no 
		four-letter-word that begins with r___ (we learned from our bike trip that 
		the mention of this word was an invocation). We paddled a lot without 
		seeing a great deal of wildlife and tried to sing songs to pass the time. 
		We have forgotten every song we've ever known -- pretty bad. After lunch at 
		a creek bed we looked for a campsite. The chart showed two nice coves up 
		the beach and then a high tide passage between the one-time island and a 
		smaller one. We followed the shore line and found what we thought was a 
		cove but disagreed as to whether it was the one we wanted or not. For once 
		we felt the distance was too short. It looked like a nice place out of the 
		wind. So, after watching a bull moose grazing in the distance, then moving 
		off, we decided to make camp. It was early in the day, but being ahead of 
		schedule with the tide going out, it made for an appreciably shorter 
		distance to carry the gear and the kayak.
		</p>
		<p>
		After setting up we decided to take a walk to establish which of the coves 
		we had found. The answer was neither. We were at a high tide passage, 
		actually camped on a small island. At the time we thought that was really 
		cool.
		</p>

		Al moved down the beach to make dinner. He was unaware of Louie's animal 
		sightings across the high tide passage on the other shore. When he called 
		her to eat he asked, "Did you see any wildlife?" and was amazed when she 
		said, "Yes, three bears." At first Al was disappointed not to have seen the 
		bears. Then, as we ate, first one and then the other two crossed a sand bar 
		that had been exposed by the low tide. They all disappeared into the scrub. 
		Uh oh. We are on a very small island with three bears. The tide would 
		come in during the night and probably persuade the bears to stay the night. 
		In the middle of the wilderness we were faced with a population explosion. 
		"Well, Goldilocks, we had better leave. We just ate all the porridge," 
		kidded Al, one of his rare bad jokes. So, after craftily avoiding carrying 
		our gear up a long beach, we had to carry it a greater distance back to the 
		shore. And then, we would have to lug it back up onto a new spot. We 
		paddled back the way we had come to the other side figuring the bears had 
		gone one way, so we'll go the other.
		</p>
		<p>
		[DAY 6] When we awoke the next morning we looked forward to an easy exit 
		off a rare sand beach. We did exit, quickly. The beach was a haven for 
		sand fleas, which had little respect for bug repellent. We sprayed and 
		rolled on chemicals as fast as we could, but the thousands of little buggers 
		stayed a distracting inch or two from our faces the whole time. Once on the 
		water the sand fleas followed. They were hitching on our clothing. Al 
		removed his hat and beat on Louie trying to drive them from her clothes. 
		However, there was no one to perform the reciprocal duty for him. We paddled by 
		the passage where we had tried to camp the day before, but could not enter 
		at such a low tide. Around the island we went. The way beyond was a series 
		of small islands or islets not navigable at low tide. We stopped at a 
		promising entrance (no fleas??) for breakfast. While waiting for the tide 
		to come in, some whales rolled and slapped the water with their flippers. 
		Not long after breakfast we worked our way through a maze of islets until we 
		were in clearer waters. We were now in the Beardslees, a group of islands 
		that as recently as 150 years ago were under an ice cap. The land is now 
		going through iso-something-or-other, i.e., glacial rebound. Chart problems 
		abound due to this phenomena.
		</p>
		<p>
		After another game of "which island is which?" and more whale sightings we 
		took a break on "Borneo," a name Louie made up because of its shape. As we 
		listened and watched the distant whales a large shape appeared at the end of 
		the beach, which transformed into a bear heading our way. Back into the 
		kayak we sprang, with Al singing "Bear Necessities" to let the bear know we 
		meant no harm. Where's the logic in that? (Have you ever heard Al sing?)
		From the kayak we safely observed the bear having a mussel lunch, scooping 
		the shelled creatures off the beach and crunching away. He had no use for 
		us.
		</p>
		<p>
		We had been told that Link Island was a good place to camp, but after 
		circling it we had not located a good spot. So, we traveled to Kidney 
		Island, which someone more important than Louie named for its shape. There 
		we found a great spot with a freshwater stream and protection from the wind.
		</p>
		<p>
		[DAY 7] Our plan for the morning was to cruise past Spider and Eider 
		Islands, restricted nesting sites. We were not allowed to land and needed 
		to stay 100 yards away. We happily complied with these regulations by 
		paddling past Spider where we saw a bear chasing ducks. It was interesting 
		to see the bear raise up on its hind legs whenever he would scare up a duck. 
		The ducks probably didn't enjoy it and the duck nesting season was not too 
		successful -- the bear was not obeying the rules. As we watched the bear, a 
		whale surfaced right behind us with a big blow, that attention-grabbing 
		whooshing sound. Farther ahead we could hear barking noises coming from 
		Eider Island. What kind of birds are these? Seals. An island named after 
		a duck is home to a breeding seal colony? There were hundreds of moms and 
		pups bobbing around in pairs. One large skull-like head followed by a 
		smaller version. And then there were loud slapping noises behind the kayak. 
		It was the bull seals telling us to keep moving. The barrage of plunging 
		seals, sounding as if we were being shelled, made sure we did. The whale 
		was still nearby and the bear was still chasing ducks. Which way were we 
		supposed to look? It was sensory overload!
		</p>
		<p>
		Next stop: Secret Bay. It wasn't a challenge to find it (were we getting 
		the hang of reading the chart?). Following the eider ducks to a passage not 
		yet covered by the rising tide we broke for lunch. The kayak was still in 
		the water when a thrashing crackling noise announced the arrival of a (you 
		guessed it!) bear. Before we had time to react, the bear turned away from 
		us ambling along the beach the other direction. While waiting for the tide 
		to reach maximum Louie explored the potential opening between Young Island 
		and the entrance to Bartlett Cove. It looked possible. The tide was almost 
		in, yet the creek bed was just mud. Not even an inch of water appeared to 
		allow us to tow the kayak the 50 feet to open water. We could have tried 
		portaging, but it just wasn't to be. "We came to paddle, let's go around," 
		said Al. Louie concurred. So we paddled back out of Secret Cove in order 
		to round the island group rather than cut through it.
		</p>
		<p>
		The sun came out after a two day absence with seals and whales putting on 
		an evening performance easily viewed from our campsite on Young Island. Our 
		last night in the wilderness -- the silence, the majesty of the snow-capped 
		mountains, the late sunset...we were witnessing all the treasures. As we 
		put our heads down for the night we thought we were just three miles from 
		Bartlett Cove, just an easy paddle in the morning. We had made it.
		</p>
		<p>
		[DAY 8] Our final morning dawned overcast with the feel of r___ in the 
		air. The time to end our adventure had come. We would miss the closeness 
		of nature, but we were ready for hot water and soft chairs.
		</p>
		<p>
		We paddled out of the cove and headed toward the end of Young Island 
		prepared to round the point toward Bartlett Cove. We knew the tide was 
		against us and had noticed the markings that said "rip-tide" on the chart, 
		but assumed they were farther out. Paddling against the tide had not 
		hindered us thus far and the early morning waters were normally calm.
		The first indication of trouble was seeing the water swirl and twist in 
		front of us. Al steered toward shore, but the tide was too low to avoid all 
		the rocks and shoals close in. A little farther out was a kelp bed. "Kelp 
		is our friend," Louie said quoting something she had read. It is supposed 
		to break the tidal flow. Sure. But why does it get tangled in your paddle 
		and prevent you from putting the blade into the water? Well, the way one 
		should break through a rip-tide is to cross it perpendicularly, so we agreed 
		to go farther out since we couldn't go farther in. Of course, there the 
		tide was at full flood. After several minutes of frantic paddling we 
		changed course again to dive into the shelter behind a point. We needed the 
		rest to get ready to fight our way around the point. Once around it seemed 
		easier. However, as soon as we passed the creek we had tried to navigate 
		the day before, the situation worsened. In fact, it was worse than before. 
		Attempts to duck back toward shore were met with such force that we went 
		backwards and for a time Al stubbornly refused to give up our position while 
		staring at a rock that remained off our port side for fifteen minutes. 
		Louie stopped paddling. "What's wrong?" Al asked the rhetorical question. 
		Louie just answered, "Nothing" out of total frustration. And as we started 
		slipping backwards Louie finally took up the paddle again. A whale surfaced 
		not far behind us. It was going to race us to Bartlett Cove; it would 
		definitely win. Since we couldn't paddle forever and not make progress, we 
		had to surrender some of the distance we had fought for in order to reach 
		shore. We crossed the path of the submerged whale. Though the 
		uncomfortable feeling that it may come up as we did bothered Louie, we both 
		had our immediate concern of getting to shore more on our minds. (The whale 		surfaced far enough away for comfort.)
		</p>
		<p>
		Once we reached shallow water Al instructed Louie to get on the beach and 
		walk around the last point while he towed the kayak. He valiantly trudged 
		and dodged boulders as the lightened kayak glided over the submerged rocks. 
		After he had cleared most of the turbulent water he gained confidence to 
		carry on. He turned toward Louie to inform her he was going to carry on, 
		but then misplaced his footing and fell over face first into the water. The 
		journey was all but over and one of us had fallen in. Al waded ashore and 
		changed his socks. Fortunately, every other garment was nylon and shed 
		almost all the water from the brief encounter. Al mentioned, "By the way, 
		the water IS cold."
		</p>
		<p>
		We climbed back in and headed out. The rudder refused to go down. No 
		surprise that the ensuing whack from Al's paddle helped release some of the 
		pent up emotions. Rounding the point we spied the dock by the Ranger's 
		Station a mile or so away. The tide was with us, but being a cove it was 
		not going to give us back the same surge we had resisted. The whale 
		surfaced and waved it's fluke as if to say farewell. It had taken us three 
		hours to cover that last 3 mile stretch.
		</p>
		<p>
		But now, who cares? We made it! Our elation wiped away any misgivings. 
		We arrived at 11:00 am; it began to rain at 11:30. We had spent eight days 
		in one of the wettest places in North America and hadn't felt a drop. Let 
		it rain.
		</p>
		<p>
		All toll, we saw eight bears, seven moose, one sea otter, four puffins, 
		hundreds of seals, more than 20 whales up close and at least as many 
		dolphins. Eagles, eiders, guillemots, ducks, hummingbirds, and two 
		porcupines were also a joy to watch. Now for a hot shower!

EPILOGUE

		<br />
		<p>
		The whole adventure was so exhilarating that we elected to omit a few 
		negatives. As with all adventures, there was luck involved and maybe a few 
		unwise moments. Since this story might inspire others to take a similar 
		trip, we feel it our duty to point out the following.
		</p>
		<p>
		We were quite disappointed with the service given by our outfitter, Glacier 
		Bay Sea Kayaks. Kara expected us to ask the questions, but we are so novice 
		we didn't know what to ask. Al told me he wanted to have a spare paddle, 
		but Kara didn't even mention it when we got all our stuff together, so the 
		omission could have been a serious problem. One paddle is not enough to get 
		that kayak through miles of water with no one around to help.
		Even when we remembered to ask for one, only an answering machine was at 
		the other end of the phone. Another outfitter, Sea Otter, provides a spare 
		paddle, as well as other nice extras: stuff sacks, map holder, boots.... 
		Al had asked if there were any areas where we had to worry about the 
		currents. His answer was "no, just watch the wind and tide combinations, it 
		might get choppy." In contradiction to this, when we had completed our trip 
		and were returning our equipment to the kayak shack, we encountered a couple 
		preparing to leave. As we attempted to warn them about the conditions we 
		had just experienced, they halted our tongues by saying they were already 
		informed not to attempt that dangerous route, rather to wait for high tide 
		and sneak through the passage behind the cove. What does one say.
		Our problems with the chart were mainly inexperience and the vastness of 
		Glacier Bay. There are no man-made reference points and everything just 
		seems so much closer than it truly is. Not knowing how to measure the scale 
		except for the latitude markings 10 miles apart, the detail could have been 
		better for the area we covered (the $14.00 chart covers all of Glacier Bay), 
		and some help from our outfitter would have been nice. The age of the chart 
		was also a problem: fourth edition, March 6, 1993. As we discovered, 
		glacial rebound made a lot of the Beardslee Islands connected, or at least 
		the passages were open for only brief periods.

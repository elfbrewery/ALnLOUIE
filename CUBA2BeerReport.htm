				Cuban Beer Report Part 2
			</h1>
		</div>
  	<p>
    	Our 2014 continuing search for Cuban regional beers (beer brewed for Cubans and priced in national pesos) started in Baracoa, 
     	which is found on the eastern end of Cuba. It was our second day there and we had had no luck, yet. Stopping to use a public "ba&ntilde;o" 
     	along the Malec&oacute;n, I walked through the wrong door into a storeroom with some crates of empty beer bottles. Later, as we walked back 
     	to our accommodations, a truck containing similar crates went by. Louie took off to follow, but the truck disappeared around the corner.
      "I know where to look," Al remarked confidently. We headed back to the "Caracol" (snail), the place next to the ba&ntilde;o. We walked up to 
      the bar, but we got a cool reception. We asked for "cerveza" but were told "finished" and advised us to try the restaurant around the 
      corner, which didn't even serve beer. However, later that night we returned to the Caracol.	
		</p>
  	<p>
			We saw some activity in the Caracol, so asked for a couple beers. We were put off again, but this time it was, "wait 20 minutes 
   		in the fresh air." So, we walked across the Malec&oacute;n to sit along the seawall. We had no idea, but it's a pleasant evening. Almost 10 
   		minutes later, Al sees a bottle being opened. He jokes, "the guy is going to bring us our beers." Lo and behold, he does just that!
    	Bringing us each a bottle of Latina and says if we want more, just ask. So we drank the first beers, peeled off the labels and 
    	discussed the beer. Nothing inferior about the beer. 4.5% is better than 5.4% for us. So, we finished our beers and decide to buy 
    	3 more -- one for our new buddy, Erasmus. We sat on the wall by the sea and he told us he lives very nearby on the Rio Miel, where 
    	it is great to swim. "Come visit me for lunch!" he implored, but we told him our schedule wouldn't accommodate it, but we were quite 
    	honored by his offer.	
   	</p>

				Moving on to Santiago de Cuba, the second largest city on the island, the regional beer here is Hatuey, named after the heroic, 
		    revolutionary Ta&iacute;no Indian chief the Spanish encountered upon arrival. All that's left is his name on a beer bottle (and a monument 
		    and stories). Our search for this beer was getting frustrating. We had lots of advice that took us back and forth, up and down lots 
		    of streets. We saw a lot of Santiago this way. On our way to Plaza del Mar, we spied the green and brown bottles mixed in a beer crate. 
		    A woman was selling frozen hot dogs in a narrow doorway in front of a stack of them. On closer inspection, they were full of juice. 
 			  However, Rafael, an enterprising young man, asked what we were looking for. When he heard our story, he invited us into the room behind 
 		   the hot dog lady. Inside, salsa music was blaring and a few couples were vigorously dancing. Rafael took us to a bar with cases of empty 
 		   bottles stacked nearby. Hmmm. Not to be deterred, he left to retrieve 3 warm bottles of Hatuey, some glasses and ice cubes -- beer on the 
 		   rocks. The labels were too dry to peel off, but Rafael told us we could certainly come back and he'd have labels for us. We later found 
  		  plenty of Hatuey at the Taberna Delores and the labels came off easily. By now we were getting the impression that beer is properly served 
   		 cold and it is drummed into the people who serve it.

				Next stop was the UNESCO World Heritage city of Trinidad. As we wandered through Trinidad's colorful streets in search of the internet 
    		office, Al discovered the "World of Beer." It wasn't open, but the signs showed brands of beer from all over and several different Cuban 
    		brands we weren't aware of. We'll be back here later. After lunch we discovered an ice cream stand selling La Palma, obviously a local beer 
    		favorite of regional beers. We tried a couple before proceeding down the street. What's this? A fellow is serving beer from a fancy tap at 
    		a window. The beer engine read Tinima Especial, but we think it's La Palma. He charged us 10 pesos each for a small cup, which we quietly 
    		frowned at, knowing the price of regional beers. Later we returned to the World of Beer. It was open, step one, but all they served was 
    		Cristal and Bucanero, both tourist class beers paid for in tourist currency. A big dissapointment.

    		Arriving in Playa Larga, we were sure we would drink some Bruja, our favorite from our visit last year. However, there wasn't any to 
      	be found. We inquired at several national currency bars, but our only hope was at last discovering an empty case of Bruja -- "finished." 
      	After three days, our English-speaking Swedish friend Hans told us he had tried a new beer at a place we knew. He didn't like it; it was 
      	Bruja. Off we went to the "Rincon." Sure enough, they were serving it. We had survived the drought.
   	</p>
 
  	<p>	
 				Meanwhile, we had also found a self-standing beer tap appearing in the market area on a few occasions. We're not positive the beer was 
     		Bruja, but it was from Villa Clara where Bruja is produced. 
   	</p>
    <p>
    		An interesting beer test we were able to conduct was to drink green-bottled Bruja versus brown-bottled Bruja. We know that green bottles 
     		allow more light to strike the beer and give the beer a skunky taste, which makes certain beers present a distinctive flavor (like Heineken's,      
     		Beck's, Grolsch and more). So we were delighted when we discovered a true difference between the same brew just because of the color of bottles.
      	The green bottles actually tasted better to us, but that's our opinion, as well as some of the locals.
    </p>
    <p>
      	Back in Havana we spotted another regional beer that hadn't been available on our first trip. After several very frustrating attempts to 
      	buy some, we gave up -- we weren't able to get a label even. We're not sure of the name, but we think it was Tinima or Tropical. If you ever 
      	get to Havana and find some, let us know!

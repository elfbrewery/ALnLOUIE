		Eleven of us from Posada Concepci&#243;n, south of Muleg&#233;, drove up to Las Tres V&#237;rgenes,
		a geothermal area just east of Highway 1 between Santa Rosalia and San Ignacio. Our intention was to 
		arrive sometime in the afternoon of December 28th, 2010 and stay one night at the hunting lodge, some 
		sleeping in the caba&#241;as, others in their campers. On the second day we would hope to see bighorn sheep, 
		walk, see volcanic stuff and whatever was available. My husband and I arrived around noon. Oscar, the 
		first man to greet us, was in a little of a panic because the staff had no idea when we were to arrive 
		that day, they had been anticipating us all morning. My fault. Alfredo, the absent main guide, had asked me via 
		email when we would come, but I thought he meant dates, not time. It makes sense now. <br/><br/>

		The first thing Oscar did, though, was offer us coffee and lunch. Our group had agreed to come 
		self-sufficient, so we didn't take him up on lunch, but enjoyed the good coffee. While we were discussing 
		our communication problems, another of our group drove straight up the main road, so Oscar gave me a 
		Gatorade and said, "get in" (into his truck) and we drove after him. Not a problem, it's just that the 
		staff are really concerned about our safety. "We are responsible," Oscar kept saying. By the time we 
		caught up with our renegade, another truck (the patrolling white pickup from the geothermal plant) had already started pursuing him 
		to the gate (about 8 miles in from the Highway 1). We had him cornered and he laughingly confessed. What we were to learn was that the staff 
		have permission to take us anywhere in the ejido, but they are responsible for us, so all we have to do 
		is ASK. By the way, we were told that the electricity from the plant powers the area from San Ignacio to 
		Santa Rosalia (maybe even Muleg&#233;?). There are 100 employees that work for the geothermal plant. Some 
		work in offices in Santa Rosalia, but most work either first or second shift. The pipelines running along 
		the road carry steam from the plant that condenses and flows into catchments. The water from these 
		catchments are recycled into the plant. <br/><br/>

		The Ejido Alfredo V. Bonfil is defined by land boundaries and by membership. The land is vast: from San Francisquito to 
		San Ignacio (including Santa Marta and Sierra San Francisco), past Muleg&#233; to Playa El Coyote. The 
		area is 519,000 hectares, the membership is 142. These members work for the benefit of the land and its 
		population. Someone may be able to explain the ejido structure in more detail. <br/><br/>

		The rest of our band came in over the next couple hours. Meanwhile, we were helped with our gear to move 
		into our caba&#241;as, make our beds, you name it. Oscar made a point of learning everyone's name and 
		introducing us to Jos&#233;, a ranger I believe, &#201;lias, the treasurer, and Juan, who has been here 
		for 15 years. Once everyone was settled in, whether inside or in their campers, we took a 2 hour stroll 
		out to the lava flow (3 miles return). It was a chance to stretch our legs and view the vegetation and 
		animal tracks: cattle, deer, mule, fox, rabbits. A nice view of "El Barco" (Ship Rock) was afforded to us. 
		The trees were typical to the area, but only the copalqu&#237;n grew on the old lava flow. Plenty of cholla to 
		dance around as well. <br/><br/>

		Back at the lodge with the huge kitchen, it was after 5pm and our group took over heating up all the 
		prepared pots of soups, beans, rice and more. We were spending so much time looking over the "trophies" 
		and reading about them, while slurping away, that we missed the best part of sunset. Oscar, whose main 
		job was to translate, had Jose tell us about tomorrow's activities. We discussed the possibilities and 
		decided to leave at 8am after coffee (at 7am) and breakfast, then try to find the bighorn sheep, walk 
		the canyon, view the fumaroles and see more of the area around the geothermal plant. By 8pm all were 
		heading to their sleeping stations. Oh, and we were supplied electricity for lighting our rooms from 
		6pm till 10pm and then again in the morning while we got our acts together. <br/><br/>

		In the morning, Alfredo, our contact, and others appeared. Alfredo, Oscar and Jos&#233; would be our guides for the 
		day, but others came along to help spot animals. Then 10 of the 11 (one had a bad tummy) jumped into 
		vehicles, some in their own, others in the ejido's and departed on schedule. We were escorted past the 
		gate to around Km 15 of the main road and climbed up to the viewing platform to look for sheep. The high-power binoculars 
		were required to spot the animals almost a kilometer away on the other side of the canyon. Some of us got 
		to see one bighorn and some got to see a deer. <br/><br/>

		When the patience dwindled, we drove a little farther to the trailhead and descended into the canyon. 
		Now, most of our group have not done much canyon walking this season, so this was not another walk on 
		the beach. Our guides informed us that before the 1959 floods, there used to be a road through the canyon 
		to a rancho. (I got the impression the rancho may still be there, but we never saw it.) A little later we 
		were told that before Hurricane Jimena brought down the rocks all along the canyon walls, the walk along the wash 
		was very pleasant. Our trek required stepping up and over many landslides, but there were nice sections 
		of wash and tufa to soften our footsteps. Some of our party started to get too stressed, one finally quit 
		only minutes from our destination (after some ibuprofen and rest, she was fine). The rest of us endured to 
		reach the thermal springs and rock art. 
		Compared with the beautiful canyon, this was an anticlimax, but still interesting. LUNCH. The return was 
		quicker, taking only 1.5 hours instead of 2.5. The length of the walk was 5 miles in and out. There were 
		places to stop to examine geology, like the seashells imbedded in the floor and ceiling of a cave. The 
		story goes that when the Baja Peninsula separated from the Mainland, there was an upthrust of the Peninsula 
		and the seafloor can now be seen in this canyon among other places. I must make a disclaimer that I am 
		giving my impressions of what was said, not what is the truth. <br/><br/>

		Back at the vehicles we carried on to the end of the road (Km 17+), where there was some more geothermal 
		machinery, we clambered over rocks to view fumaroles or steam vents. There is a small viewing platform 
		here and the only place we smelled sulfur. <br/><br/>

		We stopped on the way back to camp to try again to view sheep. One did appear, but only showed its wide, 
		white back end, no profile; however, its horns were enormous, if that's what I saw.<br/><br/>

		We're pooped. Time to pay up and drive home. We thanked everyone smilingly because it was a successful 
		trip. <br/><br/>

		Now for more details and a little perspective. The lodge area was initially built up to care for the 
		licensed hunters. There are 6 or 7 permits granted each year. In 1994, 90 sheep were counted. Now 450 
		exist. Only the rams are shot, which are normally 8-10 years old, mainly because of the size of the 
		trophy. Each hunter comes to hunt for 10 days, sometime between the end of November and late 
		March. He is guided all over to view his perspective target and when he chooses his sheep he shoots it 
		(at around 300 yards). Saying that, one can begin to understand the attention the guides and staff give 
		to their clients and wildlife. However, there is a shift to more tourism, but it's in its infancy. <br/><br/>

		We got our initial information by quizzing 
		<a href="http://forums.bajanomad.com/viewthread.php?tid=49371#pid573263">Baja Nomads</a>. 
		BajaBlanca provided us with photos and contact information</a>. b1 added 
		<a href="http://forums.bajanomad.com/viewthread.php?tid=49346#pid571830">more photos -- scroll down the page</a>. 
		I then contacted Alfredo as to reserving 2 rooms for 1 night and a tour the second day. We got partial 
		answers to a lot of our questions. This is what we learned in the end. <br/><br/>
		 -- Getting to the lodge, for lack of a better word, was simple and required no special vehicle. Just 
		 drive to the turnoff from Highway 1 near Km 32 (20 miles north of Santa Rosalia) and turn east. Soon 
		 you will see a hill to your left with structures. Turn left at the sign and drive up the dirt road. 
		 There is always someone there, I'm told. <br/><br/>
		 -- It is best to bring all your food, drink, bedding. However, the kitchen in the lodge is very well 
		 equipped and the staff are happy to rustle up some grub and coffee for you. They eat here, too. Each 
		 caba&#241;a has a bed platform, toilet, nice mural and hot shower. There are 5 buildings with 2 rooms in 
		 each building. The decks make great  viewing areas with table and 2 chairs each. One of the caba&#241;as 
		 is intended to house the hunting party, the other 4 for tourists and staff. Two of those buildings 
		 have mattresses enough for 3 doubles and 1 single. As I mentioned, electricity is available during 
		 the dark hours as needed. One of our couples used an inflatable to sleep on the bed platform in the 
		 hunters' caba&#241;a and another couple slept in the cook's caba&#241;a. This is all interchangeable as required, 
		 but more mattresses need to be purchased by the ejido. <br/><br/>
		 --  Many of our group wanted to bring dogs. Well, dogs are okay at the "lodge," and they will be 
		 watched, however, they are not allowed on the walks or in the buildings. It's best not to bring them 
		 if you are thinking about taking them on hikes; it's not going to happen. <br/><br/>
		 -- There is more to be seen here and the program is very flexible, especially if there is not a hunting 
		 party. One of the other options is to walk the La V&#237;rgen volcano. This is a minimum 2 day trip, ideally 
		 3 or more days. Day 1 would be to drive to the trailhead, walk up a ridge to base camp. Day 2 would 
		 include the ascent and then back to the vehicles. Everything included, this would cost 1000 pesos 
		 (for 2 days), if they add mules, there would be an extra charge. I can definitely see a lot of potential 
		 for other more casual trips in this area because of the quiet, beauty, accommodation and great staff. <br/><br/>
		 -- We paid 500 pesos for each room (no matter how many occupants). When asked what the charge was for 
		 the second day tour was we were quoted $50 US per person. We agreed on a price of 350 pesos per person, 
		 since we were under the impression that this was what to expect; the first day's walk was gratis. No 
		 problem. Camping was paid by tip/donation. As I said, the tourism is still in its infancy. <br/><br/>
		 -- As to touring the geothermal plant, I suppose that can be arranged, but it's not really part of the 
		 flora and fauna. <br/><br/>
		 -- Contact Alfredo Avi&#241;a Barajas, cell: 615 106-8998, email: alfredoborrego36@hotmail.com for 
		 reservations. The phone at the lodge is 615-15-54241, and the cell phone for Oscar Castaneda is 615-10-68999. 
		 As mentioned above, there are staff here, but they need to know who to expect and when; 
		 it is best to avoid conflicts. Many of the staff we met understand English and speak at least a little. <br/><br/>
 
			While on your walks, remember: keep together, keep your voices low. <br/><br/>

			Enjoy your time there.<br/><br/>

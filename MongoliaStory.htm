					Our side trip to Mongolia started out as an afterthought. Like the Trans-Siberian Railway, 
					it had to do with one of Louie's fascinations. As a child she became captivated by the story 
					of Roy Chapman Andrews, who had discovered the first dinosaur eggs in the Gobi Desert of 
					Mongolia. So much so, she read the book over and over, until it disappeared  from the local 
					library. She hadn't thought about it much until she came across a reference to it while doing 
					research for the train trip.<br/>
					So, from Irkutsk, we flew on an ancient Russian airplane to Ulaanbaatar, the capital of 
					Mongolia. The plane was a little rickety looking but the service was fine. We liked U.B. 
					(no visitor likes to spell or pronounce it), it's a great beer town. 
					See <a href="MongolianHorde.htm">Mongolian Beer</a> for more on that.<br/>
					The flight to  Dalanzadgad was on a similar plane. Upon arrival we were met by Baatuul, our 
					pretty female guide, and Ulmaa our stoic but nice male driver. The mode of transport was an 
					equally old Russian jeep. (The great thing about the jeep was that it had a starter crank, just 
					like the ones you see in silent movies. And we actually had to use it one morning when the jeep 
					wouldn't start.) It being late in the day we took a reasonably short ride to a national park, 
					where we visited a museum stuffed with stuffed animals. Some were a little ratty but it was 
					interesting to see how many different animals can live in a desert.  We then spent our first 
					night in a "ger," the typical nomadic circular hut of Mongolian herdsmen. The gers are truly 
					portable made of a large roll of felt for the base,  a many spoked support system for the ceiling 
					and a canvas cover. Ghengis Khan called his horde "the people of the felt walls."<br/>

					After a very nice breakfast prepared by Baatuul on her tiny propane stove, we were off to the 
					valley of the eagles, Khongoring Els. We spotted some high flying birds (vultures?),some wild ibex 
					and some wooly yaks -- cute aren't they? And some wild marmots, the Mongols hunt them as a 
					New Year's delicacy.<br/>

					Our afternoon lunch was at another ger where Enkhjargal provided us with cheese curd, dried 
					yogurt and vodka made from goat milk whey. The nomadic people herd many different species of 
					animals: goats, sheep, cows, horses, camels, yaks and ,in the north, reindeer. Each Mongolian 
					family specializes in one or two types. Goats are the money crop because they are combed for 
					their fine wool. These people are true nomads, feeding their animals on the sparse tundra of 
					the Gobi. They move when required by the weather, some years every week. So it is impossible 
					to find them at any given time. As we scurried across the almost featureless land we would spot 
					a ger sitting by itself with it's animals scattered around. We stopped at different gers along 
					the way and each time were treated to excellent hospitality. We later learned that our hosts 
					received no payment and our guides had never met them before and might never see them again.
					Our next attraction was the great sand dunes. The Gobi is a desert, but it has only one area 
					of sand dunes which stretch over one hundred kilometers. Louie and Baatuul insisted on climbing 
					the dunes, I was reluctant and waited part way up while Louie crawled to the top, for these photos.<br/>

		 			Each day was a little colder so when we got up for our mandatory camel ride the next morning, we 
					were dressed quite warmly. I really don't like riding animals, especially camels, but I will say 
					that the two humpers, batrick camels, are more comfortable than the one humpers that we rode in Egypt.
					The nomads at our lunchtime ger stop entertained us by playing a Mongolian violin. On our way to 
					the Flaming Cliffs we stopped in the village were Baatuul had been born. Her mother was a doctor 
					and had been stationed there at the time. Baatuul asked if we had ever had hushuur. We said no. 
					So off we went to a small shop and she ordered two a piece for the four of us. They turned out 
					to be fried meat pies. Of course, when I asked what kind of meat they contained, the answer was 
					horse. It was very tasty. <br/>

					The Flaming Cliffs, as mentioned, are home to a major dinosaur site. The archeologists and locals 
					still find eggs and bones. The museum had several different shaped examples of the various 
					cluthes of eggs. It is illegal to take them out of Mongolia, but that didn't stop a vendor 
					from trying to sell us one. Could have been a ball of mud anyway. As you can see, the cliffs 
					are really pink, but the sun can make them glow. <br/>

					As we made our way toward the airport Baatuul and the driver seemed to be searching for something. 
					Finally we pulled up to a ger with a string of horses next to it. After Baatuul conferred with 
					the inhabitants she asked us, "Have you ever had fermented mares milk?" When we said, "no," she 
					of course offered to get us some. Inside the ger we saw a leather pouch which was the fermenter. 
					The lady of the house dipped us a bowl of foamy milk which definitely had an alcoholic twang to it. 
					Next we went outside to watch the milking. Each mare has a foal tethered to it, after having the 
					foal start the milk flowing the milkmaid draws a few ounces of milk and moves on to the next mare. 
					They do this a few times a day but only when the foals are mostly weaned. When I saw a little girl 
					dipping a rope into the bucket I was glad I had drunk some before I saw what she was doing.<br/>

		Back in U.B. it was snowing. We walked a long way to visit a huge Buddhist monastery complex 
		called Gandantegchenling on the north side of the city. After our religious experience, we stopped 
		for a few more beers and some dumplings containing mutton.<br/>
		We think this was one of the most interesting and enjoyable trips we've ever made.
